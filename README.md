IS project 1
A web-based application designed to seamlessly connect farmers with credible agricultural consultants. Leveraging advanced matchmaking algorithms, the platform efficiently pairs farmers with consultants tailored to their specific needs and environmental conditions. This ensures that farmers receive relevant expertise and guidance tailored to their unique circumstances. Moreover, the application promotes transparency and accountability by allowing users to review and rate consultant services, enabling future farmers to make informed decisions when selecting experts. By facilitating direct interaction and feedback between farmers and consultants, the platform fosters a collaborative ecosystem aimed at improving agricultural practices and outcomes. 
Additionally, the application features a robust Q&A forum where farmers can pose inquiries and receive timely responses from a diverse pool of consultants, further enhancing knowledge-sharing and problem-solving within the agricultural community. Through the integration of technology and expert knowledge, the project seeks to empower farmers with the resources and support necessary to optimize their farming practices, increase productivity, and achieve sustainable agricultural success.
